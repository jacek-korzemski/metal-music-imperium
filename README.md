# Monorepo frontend for headless backend (wordpress ðŸ¤£)

Just initialized a project, that will in future become my blog with Wordpress as a headless CMS. I'm swithing to this approach, becouse I want to practise some **MONOREPO** techniques, and I would love to include my metal catalogue as a part of the project. Gatsby seems as a good way to reach that.
